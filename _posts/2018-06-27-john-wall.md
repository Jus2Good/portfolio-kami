title: The Case For Trading John Wall
---
As you all know John Wall is the unquestioned leader and superstar of the Washington Wizards.  Mr. Wall was selected in the 2010 NBA Draft and since then his play on the court has been great, but with that being said does great **INDIVIDUAL** play matter if the team isn't doing well?

There are a few individuals that come to mind when thinking of John Wall and his impact on a team.  Boogie Cousins and Russell Westbrook are both phenomenal individual players.  Each player has consistently put up phenomenal numbers, but this success hasn't translated to the rest of the team.
