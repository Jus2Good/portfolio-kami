## Explanation

I've finally ended my Bloc course and to my dismay I have paid $9000 and I'm only 10% through the course.  Here's to wasting time and more importantly wasting money.  I will now continue on my Bloc journey on my own to find out whether I can gain the insights I originally came here for.

## Problem

The issue I have here isn't necessarily knowledge.  It's moreso time.  I've been incredibly busy and haven't had the time to dedicate to my courses.

## Solution

Spend more time working on Bloc.

## Results

TBD

## Conclusion

TBD
